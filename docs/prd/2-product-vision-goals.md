# 2. Product Vision & Goals

## The Magic: "Submit URL → Watch AI Play Your Game → Get Instant Quality Report"

GameEval eliminates the QA bottleneck for browser games by deploying an **AI agent that thinks and plays like a human tester** - discovering controls, exploring gameplay, and evaluating quality - all autonomously in minutes. Developers get actionable feedback with visual proof, not just assertions.

## Core Goals

1. **Autonomous Testing**: AI agent explores and tests games without predetermined scripts or manual configuration - true Computer Use mode gameplay
2. **Real-Time Feedback**: Users watch the AI play their game live via WebSocket updates, seeing exactly what the agent discovers
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Multi-dimensional quality scoring (0-100) with visual evidence and detailed logs - every score justified
4. **Serverless Scale**: Handle multiple concurrent game tests without infrastructure management - pure Cloudflare platform
5. **Production-Ready**: Demonstrate Cloudflare's Developer Platform capabilities for AI agent orchestration at scale

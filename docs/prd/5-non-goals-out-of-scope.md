# 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

**NG-1** User authentication and authorization - Deferred to post-MVP

**NG-2** Rate limiting - Post-MVP; will use Cloudflare's native rate limiting when implemented

**NG-3** Performance metrics (FPS, memory usage, load time benchmarks) - too complex for MVP

**NG-4** Game-specific test scripts (user-defined interaction sequences) - input schema provides basic guidance

**NG-5** Canvas-rendered games - System optimized for **DOM-based UI games** where interactive elements are inspectable HTML elements

**NG-6** Video recording of test sessions - screenshots sufficient for MVP

**NG-7** Mobile/responsive game testing - desktop web games only

**NG-8** Automated bug filing or integration with issue trackers

**NG-9** A/B testing or game version comparison

**NG-10** Analytics and usage tracking - can be added post-MVP using existing data

**NG-11** Advanced dashboard features (filtering, sorting, search) - post-MVP enhancements

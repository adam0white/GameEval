# 3. User Stories

## Primary User Flow
**As a game developer**, I want to submit my game URL and immediately see an AI agent test it, so that I can get rapid feedback on quality and bugs without manual QA.

**As a game platform operator**, I want to batch test multiple games simultaneously, so that I can efficiently validate quality across my catalog.

**As an AI game generator**, I want automated feedback loops on generated games, so that I can improve my game-building agent through iterative testing.

## Supporting Flows
**As a user**, I want to see real-time progress as the AI tests my game, so that I understand what's happening and how long it will take.

**As a user**, I want detailed visual evidence (screenshots, logs) of issues found, so that I can reproduce and fix problems.

**As a platform admin**, I want to compare test results across model versions, so that I can optimize for cost and accuracy.

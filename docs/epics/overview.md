# Overview

This document provides the detailed epic breakdown for GameEval Browser Game QA Pipeline, expanding on the high-level requirements in the [PRD](../project-brief.md).

Each epic includes:
- Expanded goal and value proposition
- Complete story breakdown with user stories
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Story sequencing and dependencies

**Epic Sequencing Principles:**
- Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure and initial functionality
- Subsequent epics build progressively, each delivering significant end-to-end value
- Stories within epics are vertically sliced and sequentially ordered
- No forward dependencies - each story builds only on previous work

**MVP Scope:** Epics 1-3 complete the MVP. Epics 4-5 are post-MVP enhancements.
